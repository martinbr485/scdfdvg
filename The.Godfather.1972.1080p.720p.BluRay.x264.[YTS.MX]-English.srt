362
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,090
I know you.

363
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,970
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

364
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,970
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,480
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,940
I heard you are not happy...

367
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,650
...with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,150
Want to join me?

369
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,280
What's in it for me?

370
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,830
$50,000 to start with.

371
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,080
Not bad!

372
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,380
Agreed?

745
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,230
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

746
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,780
Why are you so far
from the house?

747
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,110
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

748
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,490
The bodyguards are here.

749
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,740
It's still dangerous...

750
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,620
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

751
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,290
Your enemies know you're here.

752
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,040
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

753
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,000
Not yet.

754
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,510
It's out of the question.

755
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:16,390
Where are you going now?

756
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,100
To Corleone.

757
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,970
Take my car.

758
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,350
I want to walk.

759
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,150
Be careful.

760
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,060
Where have all the men gone?

761
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,310
They're all dead from vendettas.

762
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,360
There are the names of the dead.

763
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,880
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !

764
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,260
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable!

765
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,640
America! Take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

766
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:02,620
Mamma mia what a beauty.

767
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,880
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

768
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

769
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,950
Did you have a good hunt?

770
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,290
You know all the girls
around here?

771
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,290
We saw some real beauties.

772
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:58,630
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

773
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,600
She would tempt the devil himself.

774
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:14,400
Really put together.

775
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,520
Right, Calo?

776
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,280
Such hair, such mouth!

777
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,830
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

778
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

779
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,250
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

780
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,290
A type more Greek than Italian.

781
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,550
Do you know her?

782
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:47,760
There's no girl like that
in this town.

783
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,680
My God, I understand!

784
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:56,810
What's wrong?

785
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,400
Let's go.

786
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,610
It's his daughter.

787
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:05,570
Tell him to come here.

788
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,330
Call him.

789
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,720
Fabrizio, you translate.

801
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:41,790
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

802
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,800
What's her name?

893
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:45,250
It's safer to teach you English!

894
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,420
I know English...

896
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

897
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,010
How are things in Palermo?

898
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:14,070
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

899
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:18,700
How are things in Palermo?

900
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:22,200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

901
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,660
times are changing for the worse.

902
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:32,330
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

903
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:40,220
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

904
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,390
What's wrong?

905
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,730
Bad news from America.

906
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:56,900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

907
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:05,330
Let's go...you promised.

908
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,140
Fabrizio!

909
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,640
Get the car.

913
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,530
Calo, where is Apollonia?

914
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:49,790
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

915
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,120
She'll make a good American wife.

916
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,130
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

917
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:10,560
Fabrizio!

918
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,310
Where are you going?

919
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,440
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
